## 📦 Kubernetes Pods

A **Pod** is the **smallest and most basic deployable unit** in Kubernetes.

A Pod represents **one or more containers** that:
- Run together
- Share the same network
- Share the same storage
- Are scheduled on the same node

---

## 🧠 What is a Pod?

- A Pod can contain:
  - One container (most common)
  - Multiple containers (sidecar pattern)
- Containers inside a Pod:
  - Share the same IP address
  - Communicate via `localhost`
- Pods are **ephemeral** (temporary)
  - If a Pod dies, Kubernetes creates a **new Pod**, not the same one

---

## 🧩 Pod Diagram Explanation

<!-- Visual reference for understanding -->


**Explanation:**
- A Pod acts as a **wrapper** around containers
- Kubernetes schedules Pods, not individual containers
- All containers in a Pod live and die together

---

## ⚙️ How Pods Work (Flow)

1. User creates a Pod (YAML or kubectl)
2. Request goes to the API Server
3. Scheduler assigns the Pod to a worker node
4. Kubelet pulls container images
5. Container runtime starts containers
6. Pod gets an IP address
7. Pod becomes `Running`

---

## 🖥️ Where Pods Run

- Pods always run on **Worker Nodes**
- Control Plane never runs application Pods
- One node can run **multiple Pods**

---

## 🛠️ How to Create a Pod

### Create Pod using kubectl (Quick Way)

```bash
kubectl run nginx-pod --image=nginx
```

Verify:
```bash
kubectl get pods
```

Create Pod using YAML (Recommended)
```bash
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: nginx-pod
  labels:
    app: web
spec:
  containers:
  - name: nginx
    image: nginx
    ports:
    - containerPort: 80
```

Apply:
```bash
kubectl apply -f pod.yaml
```

## 🔍 Pod Lifecycle

- **Pending**  
  Pod has been accepted by Kubernetes but is not yet running  
  (image pulling or scheduling in progress)

- **Running**  
  Pod is scheduled on a node and all containers are running

- **Succeeded**  
  All containers in the Pod have completed successfully

- **Failed**  
  One or more containers in the Pod terminated with an error

- **CrashLoopBackOff**  
  Container starts, crashes, and Kubernetes keeps restarting it

---

## Check Pod Status

```bash
kubectl get pods
```

## Get detailed Pod information:
```bash
kubectl describe pod <pod-name>
```
## View Pod logs:
```bash
kubectl logs <pod-name>
```

## Access Pod container shell:
```bash
kubectl exec -it <pod-name> -- /bin/bash
```

## Delete a Pod:
```bash
kubectl delete pod <pod-name>
```

## 📌 Pods vs Containers (Quick Difference)

Container → Runs the application

Pod → Manages and groups containers

Kubernetes manages Pods, not containers directly
