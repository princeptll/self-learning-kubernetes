## 🔹 What is a Namespace in Kubernetes?

A **Namespace** is a logical partition inside a Kubernetes cluster used to organize, isolate, and manage resources.

Think of a namespace as a **virtual cluster** inside one physical cluster.

**One cluster → Multiple namespaces → Each namespace has its own Pods, Services, Deployments, etc.**
